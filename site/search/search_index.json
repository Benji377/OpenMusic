Even if it's just a simple Java app, the contributors are not just limited to developers. In fact, one of our first contributors is a designer. Apart from developer we need writers and translators to write, translate and proofread the docs and in-app texts. We also need designer to create awesome and custom app designs. If you are interested, then just keep reading below and lets hope you find something you can contribute to. Pull requests Pull requests are fundamental for the project to grow. If you find something of the app you would like to improve and you know how to do it or want to make the first step, then this is the type of contribution for you. You will need to fork the repository first, add your change and pull it back up to the main branch. Every pull request will be reviewed in detail and discussed on Github. So please, after you have submitted a pull request, stay with us as we go trough the process of reviewing the request. We know that some people are afraid of submitting pull request because they are afraid of making mistakes. But remember, nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If you submit a incorrect pull request we will not yell at you, we will give you a detailed feedback on how to improve it and give you the chance of trying again. Here is a step by step guide to submit a pull request successfully: 1. First of all you will need tools to work with. We highly suggest you to download Android Studio and Github Desktop . 2. After you have downloaded your tools, now it's time to download the project you will be working on. You can do this by forking the Repository . 3. Now you should have all the files you need on your computer, you can therefore start to change whatever part of the code you want. Please do note that the branch gh-pages cannot be edited! 4. Open Android studio and import the whole project, then run the build.gradle file. 5. Now all files should be updated and you should be ready to make your changes. 6. Once you are statisfied with your changes and would like to submit them for review, you can simply use the Github Desktop app to upload the files to the repository you forked eralier. 7. You can repeat the step above multiple times with as many changes as you want. Once you are done, you can finally create a pull request to the main project. 8. If you navigate to the repository you can open a new pull request and submit your code 9. Try to be as detailed as possible when describing your change, also try to include external sources you used as reference if possible. This was a very brief tutorial on how to create a pull request, for a more detailed an beginner friendly tutorial please visit the Github tutorial directly.

Please note that this section is meant for users, not contributors. If you want to download the project and contribute to it, refer to the contributing section Release download The easiest way to download the app is trough the Releases on Github. Before you download anything, make sure the version is the correct one. If you want to download the latest release, download the latest release with a beta tag in it, else download one without it. Beta-releases might not be stable and cause some issues while using, normal releases are better. Here is a step by step tutorial: 1. Go to the Github repository , you should now see somwthing like the image below: 2. Click on the Release tab, its circled in red in the image above. 3. Now you should be on a page that at the top looks like this: 4. Now just scroll to the end of the post where you will find a section called Assets, like this: 5. Now all you need to do is click on the SocyMusic.apk file and the download will start automatically 6. Now you need to transfer the file to your phone. You can do this by sending the file to yourself or using a cable 7. When on the phone click on it and the download process will start. 8. Congratulations! You have installed SocyMusic. If anything went wrong, please refer to the Contact section Note: Sometimes phones block the installation because they don't recognize the app, you can safely ignore it and continue the download. Source download This is a more advanced method of installing the app. It will require you to have some coding knowledge. Start by going to the Github repository and download the whole source. You could do this with GIT or just download the ZIP file. Please refer to this great guide on how to do it: Instructables . After downloading the project, navigate to the folder where the project is located and use the Gradle Wrapper to build the project. You will need to open the command line and write gradlew assembleDebug to create an apk. Now you can just transfer the apk to your phone again and install it as usual. Note: Even if you need to build the file from scratch in the source download, it does have the advantage of giving you the newest version of the app possible. This is especially useful if you plan on testing the app .","title":"Downloads"},{"location":"downloads/#downloads","text":"There are multiple ways of downloading the app, some are easier, some are harder, some are more efficient and some have special benefits.

His assignement was it to create a simple music player completely in Java for Windows using the Swing GUI builder. How well he did is not known, but what we do know is that he got inspired by that one project and decided to improve that one project. He started by rebuilding the whole project on Android, but he still was commited to only use Java in his project. Eventually he got stuckon issues he wasn't able to resolve. He therefore decided to upload the project on Github and start looking for people willing to collaborate. He eventually found some people and as a small group of people started this awesome coding adventure. Here is the current network graph generated by GitGraphJS , you can view the full graph here on Github too: PS: You will need to zoom a lot to see something here, sorry. Concept and goals With concept we mean the idea behind the app. And the idea behind SocyMusic is not tooo complicated. SocyMusic has been created with the idea of having a completely offline and open source app based entirely on Java. Another cool feature that we want to implement somewhere in the future is the file sharing feature. You will then be able to share songs with eachother and meanwhile still keep the app 100% offline because the sharing of files would take place over Bluetooth. Here are the goals achieved so far: Goal Description Tag Reached 1. Add project to Github # 24. May 2021 2. First release # 25. May 2021 3. First contribution to the project #5 27. May 2021 4.

Made whole project more friendly by adding comments # 13. June 2021 9. Added naming conventions to the project #85 9. July 2021 10. Solved one of the biggest issues so far #105 17. July 2021 11. Redesigned the app #106 17. July 2021 12. Added new backgrounds and themes #127 25. July 2021 13. Added various templates #142 3. August 2021 14. Added docs #146 5. August 2021 Compatibility The app is compatible on all Android devices which have a minimum of Android 7.0 installed. The app is actually being compiled in SDK version 30, which is the equivalent of Android version 11, this would be the best option to use the app at its fullest.
