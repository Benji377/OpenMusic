Please note that this section is meant for users, not contributors. If you want to download the project and contribute to it, refer to the contributing section Release download The easiest way to download the app is trough the Releases on Github. Before you download anything, make sure the version is the correct one. If you want to download the latest release, download the latest release with a beta tag in it, else download one without it. Beta-releases might not be stable and cause some issues while using, normal releases are better. After you go to the link above, scroll to the bottom of the page, click on Assets and download your prefered file format. APK is the recommend one. After downloading the file, transfer it to your phone and then click on it, a pop-up should appear and the installation start. Note: Sometimes phones block the installation because they don't recognize the app, you can safely ignore it and continue the download Source download This is a more advanced method of installing the app. It will require you to have some coding knowledge. Start by going to the Github repository and download the whole source. You could do this with GIT or just download the ZIP file. Please refer to this great guide on how to do it: Instructables . After downloading the project, navigate to the folder where the project is located and use the Gradle Wrapper to build the project. You will need to open the command line and write gradlew assembleDebug to create an apk. Now you can just transfer the apk to your phone again and install it as usual. Note: Even if you need to build the file from scratch in the source download, it does have the advantage of giving you the newest version of the app possible.

His assignement was it to create a simple music player completely in Java for Windows using the Swing GUI builder. How well he did is not known, but what we do know is that he got inspired by that one project and decided to improve that one project. He started by rebuilding the whole project on Android, but he still was commited to only use Java in his project. Eventually he got stuckon issues he wasn't able to resolve. He therefore decided to upload the project on Github and start looking for people willing to collaborate. He eventually found some people and as a small group of people started this awesome coding adventure. Here is the current network graph generated by GitGraphJS , you can view the full graph here on Github too: PS: You will need to zoom a lot to see something here, sorry. Concept With concept we mean the idea behind the app. And the idea behind SocyMusic is not tooo complicated. SocyMusic has been created with the idea of having a completely offline and open source app based entirely on Java. Another cool feature that we want to implement somewhere in the future is the file sharing feature. You will then be able to share songs with eachother and meanwhile still keep the app 100% offline because the sharing of files would take place over Bluetooth.
