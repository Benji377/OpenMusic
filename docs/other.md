# Other
This section is for all the things that didn't make it in other sections, but that could still be useful. Especially check out the bottom of the page where you will find a way to contact us in case you encounter any issues along the way or need a way of direct communication.

## Policy
Policies are a very important part of the project. They regulate how people interact with the project and communicate with eachother. For a resume, take a look at the [Github community tab](https://github.com/Benji377/SocyMusic/community).
There are a couple policies you should read trough before contributing to the project:
- [Code of conduct](https://github.com/Benji377/SocyMusic/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md): It regulates how people should behave to make evryone feel welcoming. The code of conduct is not something we invented,but it is something Github enforces, we just adapted ours from [Contributor convenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
- [Contributing](https://github.com/Benji377/SocyMusic/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md): It's not really a policy, but more of a guide on how to contribute properly. This assures that when contributing you have the highest chance possible to actually get your changes merged or your requests applied right away.
- [Security](https://github.com/Benji377/SocyMusic/blob/main/SECURITY.md): As of now, this still needs further development. It basically tells you which versions of the app actually faetures security support and which don't.

## Conventions
As of now, we only have one convention and it's the naming convention. It especially important for developers because it regulates how new files and resources get named. If you spot files wrongly named, feel free to report it and rename them.
We got our naming convention from an [answer on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7165582/are-there-conventions-on-how-to-name-resources/39866695#39866695). Here is an image to clarify it better:
