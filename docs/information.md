# Information

## How it started
It all started with Benji and his school project. His assignement was it to create a simple music player completely in Java for Windows using the Swing GUI builder. How well he did is not known, but what we do know is that he got inspired by that one project and decided to improve that one project. He started by rebuilding the whole project on Android, but he still was commited to only use Java in his project. Eventually he got stuckon issues he wasn't able to resolve. He therefore decided to upload the project on Github and start looking for people willing to collaborate. He eventually found some people and as a small group of people started this awesome coding adventure.

## Concept
With concept we mean the idea behind the app. And the idea behind SocyMusic is not tooo complicated. SocyMusic has been created with the idea of having a completely offline and open source app based entirely on Java. Another cool feature that we want to implement somewhere in the future is the file sharing feature. You will then be able to share songs with eachother and meanwhile still keep the app 100% offline because the sharing of files would take place over Bluetooth.

## Compatibility
The app is compatible on all Android devices which have a minimum of Android 7.0 installed.
The app is actually being compiled in SDK version 30, which is the equivalent of Android version 11, this would be the best option to use the app at its fullest.
IOS(iPhone) is not compatible and as of now there are no plans on actually coding it.
