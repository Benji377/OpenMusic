# SocyMusic
SocyMusic is an open-source Android music player written entirely in Java. It has a lot of features, like playing music in background, having a fanzy visualizer and no ads at all. It is still a big work in progress project and everyone can participate. Just read about [how to contribute](https://benji377.github.io/SocyMusic/#contributing) and help us make the greatest music player the world has ever seen!
