# SocyMusic

## Introduction
SocyMusic was originally a school project on Windows, but then I thought that it could be a nice idea to expand it. The main reason for this is that a lot of android music players nowadays have a lot of ads which I think is frustrating sometimes. After coding for some time, I soon encountered a lot of problems that took me a long time to fix, I just never coded anything for Android before, so it was really difficult at first. Therefore I decided to publish it on Github and hope that someone might want to help, and that's where we are right now. The project is open for everyone, everyone can fork it, add his own stuff or edit it and create a pull request for it. Below are some features that the music player currently has:

## Features
Note that the features listed below might be slightly outdated as I will not be constantly updating them.
- Written completely in Java
- Supports Android 6.0+
- Cool red design with custom icon
- .mp3 and .wav support
- 100% free and without ads
- Music visualizer at the bottom of the player
- Completely open-source, everyone can see everything here on Github

## Screenshots
This is what the music player looks like so far. As you can see the design has been kept very simple and minimalistic.

## Coming soon
Those are the features that will be added in the future, on some there is already being worked on, but others might take a while to get added. If you think you can do any of these or you have a feature in mind which is not listed below, you are free to fork the project, add it yourself and then create a pull request to add it to the main project, that would be great.

- Mediaplayer notification displayed while a song is being played
- Credits and settings button on the main menu
- Feature to return to the player if you exit from the app
- Shuffle mode and ability to create playlists
- Repeat mode, the ability to repeat whole playlists or songs

## Resource naming convention
When contributing to this project, it's important that we all try to code in the same style to simplify organisation and make it easier for everyone to understand the code and contribute. Thats why we have strict naming conventions.
We got ours from an [answer on Stackoverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39866695/14159914) It is very simple to follow and there is even an image that you can save on yozr desktop if you forget things easily.
