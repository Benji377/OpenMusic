OpenMusic is an open-source Android music player written entirely in Java. It's objectives are to provide top-quality music to everyone for free without any ads. It will also offer a great way to exchange music from device to device all by staying completely offline.

- We will never charge you anything. OpenMusic has been made by the community for the community.
- We will never download any of your data. You don't need any login and we don't need any of your data to work. The app on it's own only searches for songs and plays them for you.
- The app will always remain offline, this is one of our core concepts!
