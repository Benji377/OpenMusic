I started this project mainly to learn about open-source projects and collaboration with strangers. I did learn a lot, but then I overestimated myself and tried to build "the perfect music player". The project went overhand very quickly, and I tried several times to fix it up. But now I think it's actually time to put this project to rest. Nobody seems to be interested in it anymore, nobody wanted to collaborate with me on it after some time anyway, and I don't have that much free-time anymore. That being said, the project is also quite obsolete, there are great offline music players out there by now, like [Nora](https://github.com/Sandakan/Nora) and [Oto Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.piyush.music&gl=US).

Thank you to everyone that helped me out with different parts of this project, and I hope I can see you on my future projects as well. If you have any concern about my decision or something else, you can always [contact me](https://github.com/Benji377/Benji377#readme).
