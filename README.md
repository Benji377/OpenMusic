## Introduction
SocyMusic was originally a school project on Windows, but then I thought that it could be a nice idea to expand it. The main reason for this is that a lot of android music players nowadays have a lot of ads which I think is frustrating sometimes. After coding for some time, I soon encountered a lot of problems that took me a long time to fix, I just never coded anything for Android before, so it was really difficult at first. Therefore I decided to publish it on Github and hope that someone might want to help, and that's where we are right now. The project is open for everyone, everyone can fork it, add his own stuff or edit it and create a pull request for it. Below are some features that the music player currently has:

## Features
Note that the features listed below might be slightly outdated as I will not be constantly updating them.
- Written completely in Java
- Supports Android 6.0+
- Cool red design with custom icon
- .mp3 and .wav support
- 100% free and without ads
- Music visualizer at the bottom of the player
- Completely open-source, everyone can see everything here on Github

## Screenshots
This is what the music player looks like so far. As you can see the design has been kept very simple and minimalistic.

## Coming soon
Those are the features that will be added in the future, on some there is already being worked on, but others might take a while to get added. If you think you can do any of these or you have a feature in mind which is not listed below, you are free to fork the project, add it yourself and then create a pull request to add it to the main project, that would be great.

- Mediaplayer notification displayed while a song is being played
- Credits and settings button on the main menu
- Feature to return to the player if you exit from the app
- Shuffle mode and ability to create playlists
- Repeat mode, the ability to repeat whole playlists or songs
- Google Assistant support to play songs with a simple voice command

## Contributing
Everyone can contribute. We need designer to make the app beautiful, we need translators and writers to make the app globally accessible and obviously we need developers to create an awesome app!
Check out about contributing [here](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Downloading the app
There are two ways to download the app (maybe there are more, but these are the ones I would suggest):
- Downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Benji377/SocyMusic/releases/latest)
- Downloading the source code and building the app yourself
The second option might be better for people who want to have the latest version of the app

**Downloading the release**
This option is the simplest and fastest way to get the app up and running. 
1. Just follow the link above, choose your release and download the attached asset at the bottom of the page. The app file name ens with the .apk extension.
2. Once downloaded click on the file and your Android device will start installing the app
3. Well done! You made it!
Note that sometimes your phone might not recognize the app and flag it as a virus, you can safely ignore that warning

**Downloading the source code**
This is a slightly more difficult method, but still feasable.
1. In the repository, click on the green "Code" button and [download the source code as zip file](https://github.com/Benji377/SocyMusic/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract all the zip files in one place
3. Run the build.gradle file to build the project. Alternatively you can also import the project in Android studio
4. You should now have an .apk file in your "\app\build\outputs\apk\debug" folder
5. Transfer the file to your phone and install the app
