SocyMusic is an open-source Android music player written entirely in Java. It's objectives are to provide top-quality music to everyone for free without any ads. It will also offer a great way to exchange music from device to device all by staying completely offline. 

- We will never charge you anything. SocyMusic has been made by the community for the community.
- We will never download any of your data. You don't need any login and we don't need any of your data to work. The app on it's own only searches for songs and plays them for you.
- The app will always remain offline, this is one of our core concepts!

### Update: SocyMusic is being redesigned
Since a lot of people suggested to give the app a minimla and cool looking design we are now trying to acomplish this. This will probably require quite some time and till there the development on the app will kind of we put on hold. This is to prevent developers from adding new components to the app which rely on the current design of the app as we will change it in the future. Hopefully this will be our last design change and we will have a consistent layout in the future. \
Thank you for your patience and understanding, \
